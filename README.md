# JOIN
The Natural Join has been defined in the class. You have also seen it in action in SQL operations. In this assignment you will implement the join operation as Python code. Your Python program will implement some tables using suitably chosen data structures. You will write a single function/method in Python that will take two tables as arguments and return their natural join in an appropriate data structure. If needed, a separate function should be used to print tables. For example the University database has two relations: instructor and department. Your program can use these two tables as samples and compute the natural join. You can verify your implementation by doing the same as SQL operations in Postgres.

Note that you will be implementing the tables directly into your Python code. Hence there is no external input to be read in. That makes your program very rigid. Hence you should implement at least two different pairs of tables, i.e. at least 4 tables, and run your "join" method on at least three pairs. All the tables are within your Python program.
